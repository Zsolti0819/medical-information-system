Medical information system GUI in Java.

TO DO:
[]  Some appointments cannot be updated for unknown reason.
[]  At patient creation screen, fields and input data should be controlled
[]  Add search functionality
[]  loggedInUser object needs to be created to identify which user is currently logged in. (Dashboard.java)
[]  At appointment creation, created_by is set to 1. We need the loggedInUser to know who created the appointment
